# Tic-Tic-Tac-Tac-Toe-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe with a little extra! Just like the original the goal is to match 3 of your pieces in a line.

# Rules
Players must match 3 of their pieces in a line on the board like normal tic-tac-toe.

### What do the numbers represent?
Each piece has a number representing the _level_ of the piece.

### What can I do on my turn?
1. A player can place any piece from their hand onto an empty square on the board.
2. A player can place a piece from their hand of a higher level onto a piece of the opposite player/color of a lower level.
3. A player can move a piece off another piece onto an empty square or onto another lower level piece of the opposite player/color.

### What can I not do on my turn?
1. You cannot move a piece that isn't the **top** piece on the square. Only the very top piece can be moved.
2. You cannot move a piece that doesn't have a piece below it. The very first piece placed on a square can never be moved off it.
3. You can never move the piece of the opposite player/color.

### Is this game balanced?
Probably not.
